# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The Prework Study Guide Webpage serves as a quick way to get caught up on the fundamentals of frontend web development. My motivation behind this project was to brush up on frontend languages and methodolgies to prepare myself for an upcoming fullstack development project. While I did brush up on a lot of HTML, CSS, and even JavaScript, I learned about the standardization behind creating a webpage, from the HTML to the README file.
